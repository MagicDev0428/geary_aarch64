  * Installation & Licensing
    
    Please consult the INSTALL and COPYING files for more information.
    

  * Quick Start
    
    The first time Geary is launched, it will prompt for your account
    information.  Note that your email password is stored securely in the
    Gnome Keyring.
    
    Geary will then begin downloading messages in your inbox.  Only the
    most recent messages will be downloaded.  To continue reading email,
    scroll down in the message list and more email will be fetched.

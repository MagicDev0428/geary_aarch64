/**
 * The Serializer asynchronously writes serialized IMAP commands to the supplied output stream.
 * Since most IMAP commands are small in size (one line of data, often under 64 bytes), the
 * Serializer writes them to a temporary buffer, only writing to the actual stream when literal data
 * is written (which can often be large and coming off of disk) or commit_async() is called, which
 * should be invoked when convenient, to prevent the buffer from growing too large.
 *
 * Because of this situation, the serialized commands will not necessarily reach the output stream
 * unless commit_async() is called, which pushes the in-memory bytes to it.  Since the
 * output stream itself may be buffered, flush_async() should be called to verify the bytes have
 * reached the wire.
 * 
 * flush_async() implies commit_async(), but the reverse is not true.

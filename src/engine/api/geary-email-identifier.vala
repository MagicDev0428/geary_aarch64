/**
 * Each mail system must have its own method for uniquely identifying an email message.  The only
 * limitation upon an EmailIdentifier is that it's only considered valid within the Folder the
 * message is located in; an EmailIdentifier cannot be used in another Folder to determine if the
 * message is duplicated there.  (Either EmailIdentifier will be expanded to allow for this or
 * another system will be offered.)
 *
 * EmailIdentifier is Comparable because it can be used to compare against other EmailIdentifiers
 * (in the same Folder) for sort order that corresponds to their position in the Folder.  It does
 * this through an ordering field that provides an integer that can be compared to other ordering
 * fields in the same Folder that match the email's position within it.  The ordering field may
 * or may not be the actual unique identifier; in IMAP, for example, it is, while in other systems
 * it may not be.

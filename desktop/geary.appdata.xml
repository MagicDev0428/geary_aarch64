<summary>Lightweight mail client</summary>
<description>
<p>
Geary is a mail application for GNOME designed to let you manage your email
quickly and effortlessly. Its interface is based on conversations, so you can
read an entire discussion without having to click from message to message.
Geary is still in development and has a limited but growing set of features.
</p>
<p>
Geary is designed to integrate with the GNOME desktop and is completely free.
